# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Student Management Form with CRUD Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive form for student management that allows creating, editing, and logical deletion of student records with proper validation and integration with existing services.
# Details:
Develop a student management form with the following requirements:

1. Form Fields:
   - First Name (required)
   - Last Name (required)
   - Email (required, valid format)
   - Phone Number
   - Start Date (required)
   - Monthly Fee (required, numeric)
   - Status (active/inactive)
   - Any other relevant fields for student management

2. Functionality:
   - Create new student records
   - Edit existing student information
   - Logical deletion (status change to inactive)
   - Form validation with clear error messages
   - Success messages after operations complete

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Integrate with existing student hooks and services
   - Ensure changes are reflected in the main student listing
   - Implement proper state management
   - Add form validation using appropriate validation library
   - Create reusable form components where appropriate
   - Implement responsive design for the form

4. UX Considerations:
   - Clear visual distinction between required and optional fields
   - Intuitive layout with logical field grouping
   - Confirmation dialogs for deletion operations
   - Loading states during API operations

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following aspects:

1. Form Validation:
   - Verify all required fields trigger validation errors when empty
   - Test email format validation with valid and invalid emails
   - Confirm numeric validation for monthly fee field
   - Test date validation for start date field

2. CRUD Operations:
   - Test creating a new student with valid data and verify it appears in the listing
   - Test editing an existing student and confirm changes are reflected
   - Test logical deletion and verify the student status changes to inactive
   - Verify deleted students are handled appropriately in the listing

3. Integration Testing:
   - Mock API responses and verify proper handling of success scenarios
   - Test error handling with simulated API failures
   - Verify form state updates correctly after API operations

4. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify success and error messages display correctly
   - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Verify loading states display during API operations
   - Test tab navigation and keyboard accessibility

Implement unit tests for form validation logic and integration tests for API interactions using Jest and React Testing Library.
