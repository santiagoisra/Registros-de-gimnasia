# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Batch Editing for Attendance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to mark attendance for multiple students simultaneously
# Details:
Develop a multi-select interface in the attendance section allowing the teacher to select multiple students and mark them present at once. Include location selection (Plaza Arenales or Plaza Ter√°n) and date picker with today as default. Create necessary API endpoints and services in src/app/asistencias/ and src/components/asistencias/. Update existing attendance hooks to support batch operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch creation, validation of inputs, error handling, and performance with large batches. Verify UI responsiveness on both desktop and mobile devices.
