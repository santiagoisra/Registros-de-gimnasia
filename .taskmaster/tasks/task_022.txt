# Task ID: 22
# Title: Optimize Student Creation Modal for Mobile UX and Supabase Data Integrity
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign the student creation modal to improve mobile UX and ensure perfect alignment between form fields and Supabase table structure, while optimizing load times by prioritizing essential data collection.
# Details:
This task involves several key components:

1. UX Improvements:
   - Redesign the student creation modal with mobile-first principles
   - Ensure all form elements are properly sized for touch interactions (larger inputs)
   - Implement responsive layouts that work seamlessly across device sizes
   - Add clear visual feedback for form interactions

2. Data Structure Alignment:
   - Add missing required field 'sede' (location/branch) to the form
   - Add missing optional field 'apellido' (last name) to the form
   - Address the 'precio_mensual' field discrepancy - it exists in the form but not in the Supabase table
   - Prepare SQL to add 'precio_mensual' to the Supabase 'alumnos' table
   - Document any other discrepancies found between the form and database

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Make only essential fields required (nombre, sede)
   - Make non-essential fields optional (email, teléfono, apellido, notas, etc.)
   - Implement progressive form loading to prioritize essential fields
   - Optimize any API calls or data validation to minimize latency

4. Implementation Requirements:
   - Use responsive design patterns and CSS media queries
   - Ensure form validation works correctly for required fields
   - Provide clear visual feedback for mobile users
   - Triple-check data structure alignment before finalizing
   - Document the SQL changes needed for the Supabase table

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following areas:

1. Mobile Usability Testing:
   - Test on at least 3 different mobile devices with varying screen sizes
   - Verify all form elements are easily tappable and visible
   - Test with both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Validate that keyboard input doesn't obscure important form elements

2. Data Integrity Testing:
   - Create test students with various combinations of data
   - Verify all data is correctly saved to the Supabase table, especially the newly added fields
   - Test the required fields (nombre, sede) cannot be bypassed
   - Confirm optional fields (email, teléfono, apellido, etc.) work correctly
   - Test the 'precio_mensual' field after implementing the SQL changes

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and document load time improvements
   - Test on slow network connections (3G simulation)
   - Verify the form remains responsive during submission
   - Test the progressive loading of non-essential fields

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox mobile browsers
   - Test with different OS versions (iOS and Android)
   - Document any browser-specific issues and their resolutions

Acceptance Criteria: The modal should load in under 2 seconds on 3G connections, all form data should perfectly match Supabase structure, and the UX should receive positive feedback from at least 3 test users on mobile devices.
