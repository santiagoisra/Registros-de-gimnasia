# Task ID: 20
# Title: Fix Linter Errors and Deploy Stable Application Base
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve all linter errors in the codebase and perform a partial deployment to ensure the core system functions correctly. This is a high-priority stabilization task.
# Details:
This task involves systematically addressing all linter errors throughout the codebase to ensure code quality and consistency. Steps include:

1. Run the project's linter tool across all code files to identify all errors (e.g., 'npm run lint' or equivalent)
2. Document all identified errors by category (syntax, formatting, best practices, etc.)
3. Fix each error, prioritizing critical issues that might affect functionality
4. Verify each fix doesn't introduce new problems by running linter again after each significant change
5. Create a clean branch with all linter fixes
6. Prepare a partial deployment package containing only the core system components
7. Configure the deployment environment with necessary variables and dependencies
8. Deploy the stabilized core system to the staging environment
9. Document any errors that were intentionally ignored with justification

The goal is to establish a stable foundation for continued development by ensuring the code meets quality standards and the core functionality works as expected.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both code quality and system stability:

1. Code Quality Verification:
   - Run linter with zero-tolerance settings and confirm no errors remain
   - Execute a full static code analysis and document any remaining warnings
   - Perform a code review to ensure fixes maintain intended functionality
   - Verify coding standards compliance with automated tools

2. Deployment Validation:
   - Execute smoke tests on the deployed partial system
   - Verify all core system endpoints respond correctly
   - Test database connections and basic CRUD operations
   - Monitor application logs for unexpected errors
   - Perform load testing on critical paths to ensure stability under normal usage
   - Verify that monitoring tools are properly capturing system metrics
   - Create a validation report documenting the system's stability status

Success criteria: Linter reports zero errors, and the deployed core system passes all smoke tests with no critical errors in logs.
