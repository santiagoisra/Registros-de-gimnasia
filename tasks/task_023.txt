# Task ID: 23
# Title: Task #23: Implement Automated Testing for Hooks and Services with Database Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement comprehensive automated tests for hooks and services, optimize database queries for high data volumes, and create formal documentation of the database structure to improve system maintainability and performance.
# Details:
This task involves several key components to enhance the system's robustness following the post-migration review:

1. Automated Testing Implementation:
   - Create unit tests for all custom React hooks using React Testing Library and Jest
   - Implement integration tests for service layer components that interact with Supabase
   - Set up mock services to isolate tests from actual database operations
   - Achieve at least 80% code coverage for hooks and services
   - Configure CI pipeline to run tests automatically on pull requests

2. Production Monitoring Setup:
   - Integrate error tracking tools (like Sentry) to monitor runtime errors
   - Implement performance monitoring for API calls and database queries
   - Set up alerts for critical errors and performance thresholds
   - Create a dashboard for visualizing system health metrics

3. Database Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the entire database
   - Document all tables, columns, relationships, and constraints
   - Include descriptions of indexes and their purposes
   - Document stored procedures and triggers if applicable
   - Store documentation in a centralized location accessible to all developers

4. Query Optimization:
   - Identify and optimize slow-performing queries through query analysis
   - Implement appropriate indexes to speed up common query patterns
   - Consider implementing query caching for frequently accessed data
   - Restructure queries that handle large datasets to use pagination or chunking
   - Test optimized queries with representative data volumes

This task addresses technical debt and establishes a foundation for better maintainability and performance as the system scales.

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task will be verified through the following steps:

1. Automated Testing Verification:
   - Review test coverage reports to confirm 80%+ coverage for hooks and services
   - Execute the full test suite to verify all tests pass consistently
   - Perform code review of test implementations to ensure they follow best practices
   - Verify that edge cases and error conditions are properly tested
   - Confirm CI pipeline correctly runs tests and reports results

2. Production Monitoring Assessment:
   - Verify monitoring tools are correctly configured in production environment
   - Trigger test errors to confirm error tracking is functioning
   - Review monitoring dashboards to ensure they display relevant metrics
   - Test alert system by simulating threshold violations
   - Document monitoring setup for team reference

3. Database Documentation Validation:
   - Review ERD for accuracy and completeness against actual database structure
   - Verify all tables and relationships are properly documented
   - Conduct peer review of documentation for clarity and usefulness
   - Ensure documentation is accessible to all team members
   - Confirm documentation includes recent changes from migration

4. Query Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark optimized queries against previous implementations
   - Test query performance with large datasets (minimum 10,000 records)
   - Verify query execution plans show efficient use of indexes
   - Monitor database load during high-volume operations
   - Document performance improvements with metrics

Final acceptance requires demonstration of all components working together in a staging environment that mirrors production conditions.
