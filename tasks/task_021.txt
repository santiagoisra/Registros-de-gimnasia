# Task ID: 21
# Title: Comprehensive Testing of Student Management Form (CRUD)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Verify the correct functioning of the student management form (CRUD) once all dependencies are implemented, through both manual and automated testing approaches.
# Details:
This task involves thorough testing of the student management form to ensure all CRUD operations work correctly. The developer should:

1. Verify form validation for all fields (required fields, format validation, etc.)
2. Test the creation of new student records with valid and invalid data
3. Test the editing functionality for existing student records
4. Verify logical deletion (soft delete) of student records
5. Check that success and error messages display correctly in all scenarios
6. Confirm proper integration with the student listing view (new/edited/deleted students appear/update correctly)
7. Verify API service integration for all operations
8. Test edge cases such as duplicate entries, special characters in fields, and boundary values
9. Check form behavior with different user roles/permissions if applicable
10. Verify form responsiveness across different screen sizes
11. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features

All identified bugs or improvement opportunities should be documented with detailed reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and screenshots where applicable.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will be conducted using both manual and automated approaches:

**Manual Testing:**
1. Create test cases covering all form operations (create, read, update, delete)
2. Test form with valid inputs for each field
3. Test form with invalid inputs (e.g., empty required fields, invalid email formats)
4. Verify all validation error messages appear correctly
5. Test success messages after successful operations
6. Verify navigation flows (cancel, save and continue, etc.)
7. Check that edited/created records appear correctly in the listing
8. Verify deleted records are properly handled in the UI

**Automated Testing:**
1. Create unit tests for form validation logic
2. Implement integration tests for API service calls
3. Create end-to-end tests using Cypress or similar tool to simulate user interactions
4. Include test cases for:
   - Creating a new student with valid data
   - Attempting to create with invalid data
   - Editing an existing student
   - Deleting a student
   - Verifying list updates

**Documentation:**
Create a test report document that includes:
- Test cases executed
- Pass/fail results
- Detailed bug reports with reproduction steps
- Screenshots of issues
- Suggestions for UI/UX improvements
