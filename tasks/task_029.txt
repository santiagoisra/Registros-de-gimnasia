# Task ID: 29
# Title: Task #29: Implement Location Management System (CRUD)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive location management system that allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete locations through a user-friendly, mobile-first interface while ensuring data integrity with existing shifts and attendance records.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Backend Development:
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for location CRUD operations
   - Implement validation logic to prevent deletion of locations with associated shifts or attendance records
   - Design database schema updates to support location management
   - Implement proper error handling and success responses

2. Frontend Development:
   - Build a mobile-first UI within the configuration panel for location management
   - Create intuitive forms for adding and editing locations with proper validation
   - Implement confirmation dialogs for deletion attempts with clear warnings
   - Design and implement visual feedback for all operations (loading states, success/error messages)
   - Ensure real-time updates of location lists across the application (in forms, filters, dropdowns)

3. Integration Requirements:
   - Update all existing forms and filters that use location data to reflect changes in real-time
   - Ensure proper synchronization between the location management module and other system components
   - Implement proper access control to restrict location management to authorized administrators

4. Documentation:
   - Document the API endpoints and data structures
   - Create user documentation explaining the location management workflow
   - Document the impact on the overall system configuration and dependencies
   - Include information about validation rules and constraints

The UI should follow the existing design system while ensuring excellent usability on mobile devices. All error and success messages should be clear, concise, and actionable.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and cover both technical functionality and user experience:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test all API endpoints for proper CRUD operations
   - Verify validation logic prevents deletion of locations with dependencies
   - Test error handling for all edge cases

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify that location updates propagate correctly to all dependent components
   - Test the integration with shift and attendance modules
   - Ensure real-time updates work correctly across the application

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify mobile responsiveness across different device sizes
   - Test the complete user flow for creating, editing, and deleting locations
   - Validate that error and success messages are displayed appropriately
   - Test accessibility compliance

4. Critical Flow Testing:
   - Create a new location and verify it appears in all relevant dropdowns and filters
   - Edit an existing location and confirm changes reflect throughout the system
   - Attempt to delete a location with associated shifts/attendance and verify prevention
   - Successfully delete an unused location and verify removal from the system
   - Test location filtering in attendance and shift management interfaces

5. Performance Testing:
   - Verify that real-time updates don't negatively impact system performance
   - Test with a large number of locations to ensure scalability

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have administrators test the complete location management workflow
   - Collect feedback on the clarity of error/success messages
   - Verify that the mobile experience meets user expectations

Document all test results with screenshots and specific test cases for future reference.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement database schema for location management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema to support location management functionality, including tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity with existing shifts and attendance records.
### Details:
Create a 'locations' table with fields for id, name, address, status (active/inactive), and timestamps. Add foreign key constraints to prevent deletion of locations with associated records. Update existing tables that reference locations to use the new schema. Implement database migrations to safely deploy these changes.

## 2. Develop RESTful API endpoints for location CRUD operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement backend API endpoints that allow for creating, reading, updating, and deleting locations with proper validation, error handling, and success responses.
### Details:
Create the following endpoints: GET /api/locations (list), GET /api/locations/:id (detail), POST /api/locations (create), PUT /api/locations/:id (update), and DELETE /api/locations/:id (delete). Implement validation logic to prevent deletion of locations with associated shifts or attendance records. Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Document API using OpenAPI/Swagger.

## 3. Build mobile-first UI components for location management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create reusable UI components for the location management interface following the existing design system with a focus on mobile-first design.
### Details:
Develop the following components: LocationList (with search/filter), LocationForm (for create/edit), LocationDetail, and confirmation dialogs. Ensure responsive design with appropriate layouts for mobile and desktop. Implement loading states, error states, and empty states for all components. Use the existing design system for consistency.

## 4. Implement location management screens and workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3
### Description: Integrate the UI components into complete screens and implement the user workflows for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting locations.
### Details:
Create screens for location listing, detail view, creation form, and edit form. Implement navigation between these screens. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions with clear warnings about data dependencies. Implement form validation with helpful error messages. Ensure all actions provide visual feedback (loading indicators, success/error messages).

## 5. Update existing forms and filters to use the location management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Modify all existing components that use location data to integrate with the new location management system and reflect changes in real-time.
### Details:
Identify all forms, filters, and dropdowns that use location data. Update these components to fetch data from the new API endpoints. Implement real-time updates using appropriate state management patterns. Ensure consistent UI for location selection across the application. Update any hardcoded location references.

## 6. Implement access control and create documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4, 29.5
### Description: Add proper access control to restrict location management to authorized administrators and create comprehensive documentation for the system.
### Details:
Implement role-based access control for location management features. Create API documentation detailing endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes. Write user documentation explaining the location management workflow with screenshots. Document validation rules, constraints, and the impact on related system components. Include troubleshooting information for common issues.
