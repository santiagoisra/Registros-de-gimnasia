# Task ID: 28
# Title: Task #28: Implement Shift Editing Functionality in Frontend Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive shift editing feature in the frontend that allows users to modify existing shift data including name, schedule, and status through an intuitive user interface with proper form validation.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. **Edit Button/Action**: Add an edit button or action to each shift in the existing list view that opens an editable form.

2. **Edit Form Development**:
   - Create a modal or dedicated page for shift editing
   - Pre-populate form fields with existing shift data
   - Include fields for name, schedule (date and time pickers), and status (dropdown)
   - Implement responsive design for all device sizes
   - Add cancel and save buttons with appropriate confirmation dialogs

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Implement client-side validation for all fields
   - Show clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Prevent submission of incomplete or invalid data
   - Add validation for time conflicts with existing shifts

4. **API Integration**:
   - Connect to the existing backend API for updating shift data
   - Implement proper error handling for API responses
   - Show loading states during API calls
   - Display success/error notifications after submission

5. **State Management**:
   - Update the shifts list after successful edits
   - Maintain consistent state across the application
   - Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate

6. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - Ensure keyboard accessibility for form navigation
   - Implement autofocus on the first field when opening the form
   - Add confirmation before discarding unsaved changes
   - Provide clear visual feedback for form interactions

7. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant documentation with the new functionality
   - Document any new components or services created

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should be comprehensive and include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test form validation logic for all fields
   - Test state management for the edit form component
   - Test API integration methods with mocked responses
   - Verify proper handling of success and error scenarios

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify the edit form correctly loads and displays existing shift data
   - Test the complete edit workflow from button click to form submission
   - Verify state updates correctly after successful edits
   - Test navigation flows and modal behaviors

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Create scenarios that test the complete editing workflow
   - Test form submission with valid and invalid data
   - Verify UI updates after successful edits
   - Test error handling and user notifications

4. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Verify functionality works correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Verify date/time picker components work consistently across browsers

5. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Verify keyboard navigation works for all form elements
   - Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards
   - Test focus management throughout the editing workflow

6. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios for stakeholders to verify the functionality meets requirements
   - Document any feedback for potential improvements
   - Verify the feature aligns with existing UI/UX patterns

7. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and optimize form rendering and submission times
   - Test with large datasets to ensure performance remains acceptable
