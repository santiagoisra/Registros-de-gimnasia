# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement End-to-End Integration Testing for Student Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and execute comprehensive end-to-end tests for all core functionalities of the student management system with the new data structure, including student management, attendance tracking, payments, grades, and pricing.
# Details:
This task involves creating automated end-to-end tests that validate the complete workflow of the student management system after the data structure changes. The tests should cover:

1. Student Management:
   - Creating new student profiles with all required fields
   - Editing existing student information (contact details, enrollment status, etc.)
   - Viewing student details and verifying data accuracy
   - Searching and filtering students by different criteria

2. Attendance Tracking:
   - Recording new attendance entries
   - Modifying existing attendance records
   - Viewing attendance reports and statistics
   - Testing attendance batch operations if applicable

3. Payment Processing:
   - Creating new payment records
   - Editing payment information
   - Generating payment receipts
   - Viewing payment history and outstanding balances

4. Grade Management:
   - Entering new grades for students
   - Modifying existing grade entries
   - Calculating averages and final grades
   - Generating grade reports

5. Pricing System:
   - Creating and updating price structures
   - Applying different pricing rules to students
   - Testing discount mechanisms
   - Verifying price calculations

Each test should verify both the UI interactions and the correct persistence of data in the backend with the new data structure. Tests should also validate proper error handling and edge cases.

# Test Strategy:
Implement the testing strategy using the following approach:

1. Setup:
   - Create a dedicated test environment with the new data structure
   - Prepare test data sets covering various scenarios
   - Implement UI automation using a framework like Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright

2. Test Execution Plan:
   - Create happy path tests for each core functionality
   - Develop negative test cases to verify proper error handling
   - Implement cross-functional tests that span multiple modules

3. Specific Test Cases:
   - Student CRUD: Create a new student → Edit their information → Verify in listing → View details
   - Attendance Flow: Create student → Record attendance → Edit attendance → View attendance report
   - Payment Process: Create student → Add payment → Generate receipt → Verify payment history
   - Grade Management: Create student → Add grades → Calculate averages → Generate report
   - Pricing Tests: Create price structure → Assign to student → Verify calculations → Test discounts

4. Validation Methods:
   - Visual verification of UI elements and data presentation
   - Database queries to confirm data is correctly stored with the new structure
   - API response validation for backend operations
   - Cross-reference tests to ensure data consistency across different views

5. Reporting:
   - Document all test results with screenshots
   - Create a detailed report highlighting any issues found
   - Categorize issues by severity and module

All tests should be automated where possible to allow for regression testing in future updates.
