# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create and Update React Hooks for Data Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and enhance React hooks in src/hooks/ directory for students, attendance, payments, price history, and grades to enable efficient queries and mutations with the new data structure.
# Details:
This task involves creating or updating custom React hooks in the src/hooks/ directory for the following data entities:

1. Students (alumnos): 
   - Create useStudents hook with functions for fetching all students, getting a single student by ID, creating, updating, and deleting student records
   - Implement proper caching and state management
   - Handle pagination and filtering if applicable

2. Attendance (asistencias):
   - Develop useAttendance hook with functions to record, retrieve, and modify attendance data
   - Include methods for querying attendance by date ranges, student ID, or class
   - Implement batch operations for recording multiple attendance entries

3. Payments (pagos):
   - Create usePayments hook with functionality to process, track, and query payment information
   - Include methods for payment verification, history retrieval, and reporting
   - Handle different payment statuses and types

4. Price History (historialPrecios):
   - Implement usePriceHistory hook to track and retrieve historical pricing data
   - Include methods for analyzing price trends and changes over time
   - Support filtering by date ranges and service types

5. Grades (notas):
   - Develop useGrades hook with functions to record, retrieve, and modify student grades
   - Include methods for calculating averages, generating reports, and tracking progress

Each hook should:
- Follow a consistent pattern and API design
- Utilize React Query or a similar library for efficient data fetching and caching
- Include proper error handling and loading states
- Be fully typed with TypeScript
- Support the new data structure requirements
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Include documentation with JSDoc comments

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the hooks:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create Jest tests for each hook function
   - Mock API responses using MSW or similar library
   - Test success and error scenarios for each operation
   - Verify proper state updates and cache invalidation

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create tests that use the hooks in component contexts
   - Verify that components correctly respond to loading, error, and success states
   - Test that data mutations properly update the UI

3. Manual Testing:
   - Implement each hook in relevant components
   - Verify data is correctly fetched, displayed, and updated
   - Test edge cases like network failures, concurrent updates

4. Performance Testing:
   - Verify hooks don't cause unnecessary re-renders
   - Check that caching works as expected
   - Test with large datasets to ensure performance

Specific Test Cases:
- Verify that useStudents.getAll() returns the correct list of students
- Test that useAttendance.markPresent() correctly updates attendance records
- Confirm usePayments.processPayment() handles both successful and failed payments
- Verify usePriceHistory.getPriceAtDate() returns the correct historical price
- Test that useGrades.calculateAverage() produces accurate results

All tests should pass before considering this task complete.
