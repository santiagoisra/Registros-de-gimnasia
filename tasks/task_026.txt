# Task ID: 26
# Title: Task #26: Implement Configurable Appointment Management System with Student Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a flexible appointment scheduling system that allows for predefined and custom time slots with specific time ranges, complete with an administration panel and full integration with the existing student management system.
# Details:
The appointment management system should include the following components and features:

1. Appointment Configuration:
   - Support for predefined appointment templates with configurable duration, capacity, and recurrence
   - Custom appointment creation with specific date/time ranges
   - Ability to set buffer times between appointments
   - Options to limit the number of students per appointment slot
   - Calendar-based visual interface for appointment scheduling

2. Administration Panel:
   - Dashboard showing upcoming appointments, utilization statistics, and conflicts
   - Batch operations for creating, modifying, or canceling multiple appointments
   - User role management (admin, staff, student) with appropriate permissions
   - Configuration settings for notification preferences and system defaults
   - Reporting tools for appointment analytics (usage patterns, no-shows, etc.)

3. Student Integration:
   - Seamless connection with the existing student management system
   - Student profiles should display appointment history and upcoming appointments
   - Self-service booking interface for students to schedule appointments
   - Automated notifications for appointment confirmations, reminders, and changes
   - Waitlist functionality for fully booked appointment slots

4. Technical Implementation:
   - RESTful API endpoints for all appointment operations
   - Database schema extensions to support appointment data
   - Caching strategy for frequently accessed appointment data
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets for concurrent booking scenarios
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop interfaces

5. Additional Considerations:
   - Implement timezone handling for appointments
   - Support for recurring appointments (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
   - Audit logging for all appointment-related actions
   - Export functionality for appointment data (CSV, iCal, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy for the appointment management system should include:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test all appointment creation, modification, and deletion functions
   - Validate time slot calculations and conflict detection algorithms
   - Verify permission checks for different user roles
   - Test integration points with the student management system
   - Ensure proper handling of edge cases (timezone changes, daylight saving time)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify data flow between the appointment system and student database
   - Test notification delivery across the entire system
   - Validate that changes in one component correctly propagate to others
   - Test API endpoints with various request parameters and load conditions
   - Ensure database transactions maintain data integrity

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for administrators creating appointment templates
   - Simulate students booking, modifying, and canceling appointments
   - Test the waitlist functionality and automatic slot assignment
   - Verify the reporting and analytics features with sample data
   - Test the system under various browser and device configurations

4. Performance Testing:
   - Simulate concurrent booking requests to test system stability
   - Measure response times for calendar views with large datasets
   - Test system performance during peak usage periods
   - Verify database query optimization for appointment lookups
   - Assess notification system performance under load

5. Automated Testing:
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical appointment workflows
   - Create automated regression tests for the administration panel
   - Set up continuous integration to run tests on each code change
   - Develop API tests to verify all endpoints function correctly
   - Implement visual regression tests for the calendar interface

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Administrators can create and manage appointment templates
   - Students can book, view, and cancel appointments
   - The system correctly handles concurrent booking attempts
   - Notifications are sent reliably for all appointment events
   - The system maintains performance with 1000+ appointments and 500+ concurrent users
   - All appointment data is correctly synchronized with the student management system
