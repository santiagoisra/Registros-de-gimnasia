# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Price History and Notes Services with CRUD Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and expose service modules for price history and notes in src/services/ directory, implementing CRUD operations and advanced query capabilities for reports and dashboards.
# Details:
Develop two service modules in the src/services/ directory:

1. **HistorialPreciosService**:
   - Implement standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Add specialized methods for time-series data retrieval
   - Include functions for price trend analysis (e.g., getVariationByPeriod, getMaxMinPrices)
   - Implement filtering capabilities by date ranges, product categories, and price thresholds
   - Add aggregation methods for dashboard visualizations (e.g., getAveragePriceByPeriod)

2. **NotasService**:
   - Implement standard CRUD operations for notes
   - Add search functionality by content, date, and associated entities
   - Include methods for categorization and tagging of notes
   - Implement pagination and sorting for efficient data retrieval
   - Add methods to link notes with other entities in the system

Both services should:
- Follow the established project architecture patterns
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Use appropriate data models and repositories
- Be properly documented with JSDoc comments
- Implement logging for important operations
- Be designed with performance considerations for large datasets

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following areas:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each CRUD operation for both services independently
   - Verify error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
   - Mock dependencies to isolate service functionality
   - Test advanced query methods with various parameters

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between services and their dependencies
   - Verify database operations with a test database
   - Test complex queries that span multiple database operations

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark response times for retrieving large datasets
   - Test pagination efficiency with large result sets
   - Verify indexing strategies are effective for common queries

4. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Create a price history record and verify it's retrievable
   - Update a price and verify the history is properly maintained
   - Test date range filtering returns correct price history data
   - Create notes with different attributes and verify search functionality
   - Test linking notes to other entities and retrieving them by association
   - Verify aggregation methods return accurate statistical data

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
