# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Price History and Notes Services with CRUD Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and expose service modules for price history and notes in src/services/ directory, implementing CRUD operations and advanced query capabilities for reports and dashboards.
# Details:
Develop two service modules in the src/services/ directory:

1. **HistorialPreciosService**:
   - Implement standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Add specialized methods for time-series data retrieval
   - Include functions for price trend analysis (e.g., getVariationByPeriod, getMaxMinPrices)
   - Implement filtering capabilities by date ranges, product categories, and price thresholds
   - Add aggregation methods for dashboard visualizations (e.g., getAveragePriceByPeriod)

2. **NotasService**:
   - Implement standard CRUD operations for notes
   - Add search functionality by content, date, and associated entities
   - Include methods for categorization and tagging of notes
   - Implement pagination and sorting for efficient data retrieval
   - Add methods to link notes with other entities in the system

Both services should:
- Follow the established project architecture patterns
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Use appropriate data models and repositories
- Be properly documented with JSDoc comments
- Implement logging for important operations
- Be designed with performance considerations for large datasets

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following areas:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each CRUD operation for both services independently
   - Verify error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
   - Mock dependencies to isolate service functionality
   - Test advanced query methods with various parameters

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between services and their dependencies
   - Verify database operations with a test database
   - Test complex queries that span multiple database operations

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark response times for retrieving large datasets
   - Test pagination efficiency with large result sets
   - Verify indexing strategies are effective for common queries

4. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Create a price history record and verify it's retrievable
   - Update a price and verify the history is properly maintained
   - Test date range filtering returns correct price history data
   - Create notes with different attributes and verify search functionality
   - Test linking notes to other entities and retrieving them by association
   - Verify aggregation methods return accurate statistical data

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Service Class with Common CRUD Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a BaseService class that will provide common CRUD operations and utility methods to be inherited by both HistorialPreciosService and NotasService.
### Details:
Create a src/services/BaseService.js that implements:
- Generic create(), findById(), findAll(), update(), and delete() methods
- Common error handling patterns
- Logging functionality
- Validation utilities
- Pagination and sorting capabilities
This base class should be abstract and designed to be extended by specific service implementations.

Create a src/services/BaseService.js that implements:
- Generic create(), findById(), findAll(), update(), and delete() methods
- Common error handling patterns
- Logging functionality
- Validation utilities
- Pagination and sorting capabilities
This base class should be abstract and designed to be extended by specific service implementations.

The abstract class BaseService<T> has been implemented in src/services/BaseService.ts with the following features:
- Generic CRUD methods: create, findById, findAll (with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities), update, and delete
- Centralized error handling and logging using logInfo/logError functions
- Complete JSDoc documentation for all methods to facilitate usage by other developers
- Designed as an abstract class to be extended by concrete service implementations (HistorialPreciosService, NotasService)
- Implementation follows the existing architectural patterns of the project
- No previous base class was detected, so this was implemented from scratch
</info added on 2025-05-11T22:37:37.360Z>
<info added on 2025-05-11T23:58:12.102Z>
After exploring and analyzing the implementation of BaseService, it has been confirmed that the abstract class BaseService<T> has been successfully implemented in src/services/BaseService.ts with all required functionality:

- The class provides generic CRUD operations (create, findById, findAll, update, delete) as specified
- Includes robust error handling and centralized logging via logInfo/logError functions
- Implements pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities in the findAll method
- Contains comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all methods
- Designed as an abstract class that's properly extended by concrete service implementations

Current status:
- Both NotasService and HistorialPreciosService are already extending BaseService correctly
- These services add their own domain-specific methods while leveraging the common functionality
- Legacy services (alumnos, asistencias, pagos) have not been migrated to use BaseService, but this is outside the scope of this subtask

Next steps:
- Documentation has been consolidated in the README and this subtask
- Verification needed to ensure tests for child services adequately cover inherited methods
- No immediate code changes required as the implementation meets all requirements

The BaseService implementation is complete, aligns with the project architecture, and is ready for use by new services.
