# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Responsive Navigation Sidebar Across All Main Views
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a responsive navigation sidebar that remains accessible across all main application views while prioritizing mobile usability.
# Details:
Create a consistent navigation sidebar that appears on all main views including students, attendance, payments, reports, price history, grades, and other primary sections. The sidebar should:

1. Maintain visual and functional consistency across all views
2. Implement responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes:
   - On desktop: Display as an expanded sidebar or collapsible panel
   - On tablets: Offer a collapsible or mini version with icons
   - On mobile: Transform into a hamburger menu or bottom navigation
3. Include clear, recognizable icons alongside text labels for each section
4. Implement smooth transitions when expanding/collapsing
5. Highlight the current active section for user orientation
6. Ensure the sidebar remains accessible during scrolling (consider sticky positioning)
7. Implement touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px) for mobile users
8. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
9. Ensure proper contrast ratios between text and background
10. Include a mechanism to completely hide the sidebar when needed for content focus

Use CSS media queries to handle different viewport sizes and consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind for responsive behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and responsiveness:

1. Cross-browser testing:
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent appearance and behavior

2. Responsive testing:
   - Test on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) or use browser dev tools to simulate various screen sizes
   - Verify at standard breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
   - Check that all navigation options remain accessible at all screen sizes

3. Functional testing:
   - Verify sidebar appears correctly on each main view
   - Confirm active section is properly highlighted
   - Test expand/collapse functionality
   - Ensure all navigation links work correctly
   - Verify keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape)

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Run automated tests using tools like Lighthouse or axe
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
   - Verify proper ARIA attributes are implemented
   - Check contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards

5. Performance testing:
   - Ensure sidebar transitions are smooth (60fps)
   - Verify no layout shifts occur when sidebar state changes
